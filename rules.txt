Card Environments:
	(Tableau) Piles that make up main table
	(Foundations) Four piles for each suit Ace->King
	(Hand) Remaining cards not laid in tableau

SETUP
Tableau:
	7 piles
	Formation: left to right
		start with placing 7:
		place first card face up
		place the rest to the end face down
		repeat, each time starting one right until done
Hand:
	Remaining cards in deck

*** Foundations and Waste don't have any at this point ***

PLAY
- Cards in tableau stacked on next highest card of alter color
- Once card moved, if top card face down, face up
- Ace needed to start foundation pile, has to follow suit Ace->K

- If no cards played flip one from hand
- Stack cards on top of eachother until no more in hand
- Start hand over from the flipped cards

- If space opens up in tableau, can fill with a king

- Wins once suit sequences are accomplished
